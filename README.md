Tests:

yarn test:check-coverage
```

Lint:

yarn lint

# Run lint on any file change
yarn lint:watch
```

Other gulp tasks:

# install production dependencies only
3. yarn --production

# Use any process manager to start your services
4. pm2 start dist/index.js
```

## Code Coverage
Get code coverage summary on executing `yarn test`

`yarn test` also generates HTML code coverage report in `coverage/` directory. Open `lcov-report/index.html` to view it.
